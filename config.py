"""Shared configuration for the 市民大道 north/south severance analysis.

Companion to ../config.py (the activity-heatmap pipeline). Same project, a
different question: that pipeline asks *how busy* the corridor is, this one
asks whether the elevated expressway **severs** the city north from south.

SCOPE DIFFERS FROM ../config.py ON PURPOSE. That pipeline is scoped to
市民大道一段 (Datong, 環河北路–中山北路, 2 km radius). The severance question
is a property of the elevated structure, so this pipeline covers the whole
6,533 m elevated deck, 忠孝橋/環河北路 to 基隆路一段 (NOT to 光復南路,
which sits at chainage 5,188 m, 1.3 km short of the east end). 市民大道 as a street runs 13.6 km,
but 六～八段 (toward 南港) has no elevated deck and is therefore outside the
barrier hypothesis.

NO NETWORK ACCESS IS REQUIRED. CLAUDE.md records that data.taipei,
overpass-api.de and nominatim are all blocked by egress policy. Every input
here is a local file, so the whole pipeline runs offline.

Paths are relative to this directory: run scripts with `cd src/severance`,
matching the `cd src` convention the heatmap pipeline uses.
